1. complete master

2. general integration test.

4. worker down?

5. master down?

6. beautiful progress in #TODO: `local_monitoring`

7. multiprocessing map task:
from multiprocessing import Pool

def f(x):
    return x*x

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(5) as p:
        print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))




debug:

1. We know we do not go inside `handle_job` ever
2. `get_job` in watcher gets called because job is updated to in-progress


Notes:

When we submit the job the first time:
Job(state='idle', requested_n_workers=None, master_hostname=None)

When we submit the job the second time (we have two jobs, the first was assigned):
Job(state='in-progress', requested_n_workers=None, master_hostname='2b21334204d4')
