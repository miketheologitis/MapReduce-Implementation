2. Create singleton tests of the methods
    - `test_hdfs_client` singleton
    - `test_zookeeper_client` singleton

5. worker-hdfs-zookeeper integration test.

6. master complete the code, think thoroughly of the filesystem structure.

7. close() HDFSCLIENT???s

8. Master down ability. Not supported right now. Simple `JobInfo` with master `HOSTNAME`
    suffices. Will think later :)
